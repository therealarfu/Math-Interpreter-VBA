# Math-Interpreter-VBA
## Description
A **fully functional mathematical expression interpreter** built entirely in **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)**.  
It parses and evaluates math expressions with **correct precedence**, **associativity**, and **unary operator support**,  
making it ideal for **Excel macros**, **Office automation**, or just exploring compiler logic in VBA.

## How to use
First you have to download the module, and import it on PowerPoint or Excel. <br/>
After that you should be able to use the function ``Evaluate`` to calculate an expression in a String.

```vb
' It returns the result in a string.
Eval.Evaluate(Expression)   
```
